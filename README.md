To run the script, [download the script here](compile.sh) by clicking view raw and then CTRL+S to save the file.
Go to your downloads folder and open up a terminal window. Type in these commands:

## Where is the executable?
The executable is stored in ~/aseprite. Have fun!

## How do I run Aseprite?
This script automatically adds Aseprite to your desktop environment's application launcher and to $PATH.
You can launch it from your desktop environment's application launcher or by entering `aseprite` in the terminal.

## Credits
I used [Aseprite's official compilation guide](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md) to make this script.
